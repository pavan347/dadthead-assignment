# Dad The Ad Assignment

## Project Overview
This project, **Dad The Ad**, was developed as part of an assignment given by Dad The Ad agency for an internship opportunity. The task was to create a contact page using React. I chose to reimagine their website's contact page by building a fully functional contact page along with a responsive navbar and footer. The contact page includes error handling and ensures a seamless user experience.

## Features
- **Responsive Navbar and Footer**: Provides a consistent and user-friendly navigation experience.
- **Functional Contact Page**: Includes form validation and error handling for better usability.
- **Modern Design**: Reimagines the agency's contact page with a clean and professional look.
